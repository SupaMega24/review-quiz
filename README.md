This is a project I started a while ago before I knew anything about repos and commits. It was originally in Python. I used Rix AI to help me translate the code to JavaScript as I am still learning. 

I have began to style it using CSS and to add other desireable elements going by what I'm currently learning in the Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. 

This is an ongoing project and I hope to use it on my blog and possible other adventures.
